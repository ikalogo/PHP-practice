//Echo and Print statements 

/**
 * Both mainly used to print output on the screen. Echo is marginally faster than print.
 * Print, unlike echo can only accept on argument and has a return value of 1, hence it can be used in expressions while echo has none
 * The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo, echo()
